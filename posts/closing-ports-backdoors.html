  <h1>Are Open Ports a Backdoor?</h1>

  <p>Open ports are like doors into your system—some are meant to be there, others shouldn’t be. But how do you know which is which?</p>

  <h2>First, What’s a Port?</h2>
  <p>A port is a digital channel that allows software on your device to send or receive data. Common ones include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Port 80 (HTTP)</li>
    <li>Port 443 (HTTPS)</li>
    <li>Port 22 (SSH)</li>
    <li>Port 3389 (RDP)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If these ports are open and exposed to the internet—and not protected by a firewall or access rules—they can be an easy way in for attackers.</p>

  <h2>How Do Attackers Exploit Open Ports?</h2>
  <p>They scan for common ports using tools like Nmap, then try to exploit known vulnerabilities on whatever service is running. If that service is misconfigured or outdated? You're at risk.</p>

  <h2>How to Check for Open Ports</h2>
  <p>You can use simple tools like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ShieldsUP!</strong> – A free external scan tool</li>
    <li><strong>Nmap</strong> – Command-line port scanner</li>
    <li><strong>Netstat</strong> – Built into most systems to view local ports</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Close any ports you’re not actively using</li>
    <li>Restrict remote access to trusted IPs</li>
    <li>Use strong passwords and 2FA on exposed services</li>
    <li>Patch systems regularly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Every open port is a possible vector. The fewer you leave open, the less chance someone walks in uninvited.</p>
